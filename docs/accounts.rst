Account Management
==================

If you work at PGI or JCNS and have a **LDAP username**, you can use this and the corresponding password to sign in and the account will be created automatically.

If you are a guest at a facility using iffSamples, you should ask another user of iffSamples for an **invitation**, e.g. the scientist responsible for the instrument you will be using. Once you have confirmed your e-mail address by clicking the confirmation link in the invitation e-mail, you can then set a password for your new iffSamples account.

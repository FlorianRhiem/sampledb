.. _actions:

Actions
=======

Processes like **creating a sample**, **performing a measurement** or **running a simulation** are represented as actions in iffSamples and whenever such an action is performed a new :ref:`Object <objects>` should be created in iffSamples.

Either generic or associated with an :ref:`Instrument <instruments>`, each action contains a name, a description and a :ref:`Schema <metadata>`.

You can view a list of actions at https://iffsamples.fz-juelich.de/actions/. Similar to instruments, users can select **favorites** by clicking the star next to an action's name.

Custom Actions
--------------

Users can create custom actions to represent their own processes or instruments that are not yet part of iffSamples. These actions can either be private, only usable by the users who created them, or public, usable by anyone.

To create a custom action, users can either use an existing action as a template or write a :ref:`Schema <metadata>` from scratch.

.. note::
    Custom Actions are an advanced feature that most users of iffSamples will not need. If you would like your instrument or action to be included without writing your own schema, please `let us know <f.rhiem@fz-juelich.de>`_.

    If you would like to try working with custom actions, please `use the development and testing deployment of iffSamples <https://docker.iff.kfa-juelich.de/dev-sampledb/>`_.

.. _metadata:

Metadata and Schemas
--------------------

A schema specifies what metadata should be recorded when performing an action. The metadata should contain all the information required to reproduce what a user did.

Schemas are defined using `JSON <https://www.json.org/>`_. Each schema must at least include a text property called ``name``.

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: A basic schema containing a sample name, creation datetime, tags and a description

    {
      "title": "Basic Sample Information",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": {
          "title": "Sample Name",
          "type": "text",
          "minLength": 1,
          "maxLength": 100
        },
        "created": {
          "title": "Creation Datetime",
          "type": "datetime"
        },
        "tags": {
          "title": "Tags",
          "type": "tags"
        },
        "description": {
          "title": "Description",
          "type": "text",
          "minLength": 0,
          "multiline": true
        }
      },
      "propertyOrder": ["name", "created", "tags", "description"],
      "required": ["name", "created"]
    }

Data types
``````````

Currently, the following basic data types are supported for metadata:

- Texts
- Booleans
- Quantities
- Datetimes

These can be used to form the following composite data types:

- Arrays
- Objects

Additionally, there are special data types:

- :ref:`Tags <tags>`
- :ref:`Hazards <hazards>`
- Sample References

All metadata property definitions require a ``title`` and a ``type`` property. They can also contain a ``note`` property with information for users. Some data types allow or require additional properties.

Objects
^^^^^^^

Objects represent complex composite data types containing named properties. They may have a default value (``default``), a list of required properties (``required``) and a list containing the order of properties (``propertyOrder``). Additionally, they require a schema for each of their properties (``properties``).

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: An object property containing a name as a text property and a creation date as a datetime property with a property order and a required property

    {
      "title": "Sample Information",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": {
          "title": "Sample Name",
          "type": "text"
        },
        "created": {
          "title": "Creation Datetime",
          "type": "datetime"
        },
      },
      "propertyOrder": ["name", "created"],
      "required": ["name"]
    }

Arrays
^^^^^^

Arrays represent a list of items. Arrays may have a minium (``minItems``) and maximum number of items (``maxItems``) and a default value (``default``). Additionally, they require a schema for their items (``items``).

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: An array property containing texts with a default and length restrictions

    {
      "title": "Notes",
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "title": "Note",
        "type": "text"
      },
      "minItems": 1,
      "maxItems": 10,
      "default": [
        {
          "_type": "text",
          "text": "First default note"
        },
        {
          "_type": "text",
          "text": "Second default note"
        }
      ]
    }

Texts
^^^^^

Texts may have a minimum (``minLength``) and maximum length (``maxLength``) and a default value (``default``). Acceptable values can be restricted using a `regular expression <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax>`_ (``pattern``) and text properties can optionally contain multiple lines (``multiline``).

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: A sample name as a text property with a default, a pattern and length restrictions

    {
      "title": "Sample Name",
      "type": "text",
      "minLength": 1,
      "maxLength": 100,
      "default": "Sample-",
      "pattern": "^.+$"
    }

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: A sample description allowing multiple lines of text

    {
      "title": "Description",
      "type": "text",
      "multiline": true
    }

Booleans
^^^^^^^^

Booleans may have a default value (``default``), either ``true`` or ``false``.

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: A boolean property with a default

    {
      "title": "Lid Open?",
      "type": "bool",
      "default": true
    }

Quantities
^^^^^^^^^^

Quantities require units (``units``, can be ``1``) and may have a default value (``default``) given in the base units of the quantities' dimensions.

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: A temperature property with a default of 25Â°C (298.15K)

    {
      "title": "Temperature",
      "type": "quantity",
      "units": "degC",
      "default": 298.15
    }

Datetimes
^^^^^^^^^

Datetime may have a default value (``default``). Datetimes in iffSamples are written using notation ``YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`` and stored using UTC.

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: A datetime property with a default

    {
      "title": "Creation Datetime",
      "type": "datetime",
      "default": "2018-12-05 15:38:12"
    }

Tags
^^^^

Tags may have a default value (``default``). There can be only one tags property, called ``tags`` as a property of the root object.

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: A tags property with a default

    {
      "title": "Tags",
      "type": "tags",
      "default": ["tag1", "tag2"]
    }

Hazards
^^^^^^^

Hazards do not allow additional properties. There can be only one hazards property, called ``hazards`` as a property of the root object. If it exists, it must be required.

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: A hazards property

    {
      "title": "GHS hazards",
      "type": "hazards"
    }

Sample References
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sample references do not allow additional properties.

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: A sample reference property

    {
      "title": "Previous Sample",
      "type": "sample"
    }

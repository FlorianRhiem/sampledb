Basic configuration for iffSamples

This configuration is the pure base, representing defaults. These values may be altered or expanded in several ways:
- For tests, the configuration is modified in tests/conftest.py.
- For local, interactive testing and demonstrations, the configuration is modified in demo.py.
- environment variables starting with the prefix SAMPLEDB_ will further override any hardcoded configuration data.
